You are extracting business names from website titles for a pressure washing / window cleaning / wood restoration company database.

Your ONLY job: given the title, domain, and current DB name, return the **single best guess** at the COMPLETE business name, or `NONE` if there truly is no identifiable business name.

---

INPUT:
- Title: "{title}"
- Domain: {domain}
- Current DB name: "{original_name}"

---

GOAL:

Extract the **full, real-world business name** of the company that offers pressure washing, power washing, soft washing, exterior cleaning, window cleaning, or wood restoration services.

You are NOT extracting:
- the name of a directory (Yelp, Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, etc.)
- generic service phrases without any brand
- navigation/page labels like “Home”, “Services”, “About”, etc.

KEY CONCEPT: What COUNTS as a business name?

A string counts as a business name if it includes some **unique / branded element**, such as:
- A person’s name:  
  - “Mike’s Pressure Washing”  
  - “Johnson Window Cleaning”
- A unique phrase or branding word:  
  - “Hydro Softwash”  
  - “BlueWave Softwash”  
  - “Elite Pressure Pros”
- A city/region + service that sounds like a branded name:  
  - “Austin Power Wash”  
  - “River City Pressure Washing”  
  - “Lone Star Exterior Cleaning”

Service words like *Pressure Washing, Power Washing, Softwash, Exterior Cleaning, Window Cleaning, Wood Restoration, Deck Cleaning, Fence Staining,* etc. are OFTEN part of the business name. **DO NOT strip them off if they appear to be part of the brand.**

---

What is NOT a business name?

The following are NOT valid business names (these should usually result in `NONE`):

1. Purely generic descriptions with no unique element:
   - “Pressure Washing Services”
   - “Soft Washing Dallas”
   - “Professional Cleaning”
   - “Residential & Commercial Pressure Washing”
   - “Window Cleaning & Gutter Cleaning”

2. Navigation or page labels:
   - “Home”
   - “Contact Us”
   - “About”
   - “Services”
   - “Gallery”

3. Titles where only a large platform / marketplace is branded:
   - “Pressure Washing in Dallas - Yelp” → (Yelp is NOT the contractor’s name) → `NONE`  
   - “Best Pressure Washing Near Me | Angi” → `NONE`

4. Titles where the only brand is clearly the platform and no contractor name is present:
   - “Pressure Washing – Thumbtack” → `NONE`  
   - “Window Cleaning – HomeAdvisor” → `NONE`

---

LEGAL SUFFIXES:

If the business name contains legal suffixes, **remove them**:

Remove things like:
- LLC, L.L.C.
- Inc, Incorporated
- Corp, Corporation
- Ltd, Limited
- Co, Company

Examples:
- “River City Pressure Washing LLC” → `River City Pressure Washing`
- “BlueWave Softwash, Inc.” → `BlueWave Softwash`

Do NOT remove words that are part of the actual brand:
- “The Window Company” → `The Window Company` (because “Company” is part of the brand phrase)

HOW TO USE THE TITLE, DOMAIN, AND CURRENT DB NAME

You have three clues: **Title**, **Domain**, and **Current DB name**.

Use them in this priority order:

1. **Title (primary source)**
   - Look for the business name around separators like `|`, `-`, `:` or `•`.
   - Remove page-level words such as “Home”, “Welcome to”, “Services”, “Contact”, “Home Page”.
   - Patterns:
     - “Service in City | BUSINESS NAME” → take what’s after `|`
     - “BUSINESS NAME | Service Description” → take what’s before `|`
     - “Home | BUSINESS NAME” → ignore “Home”, use what’s after `|`
     - “Welcome to BUSINESS NAME” → remove “Welcome to”
     - “BUSINESS NAME - Home” → take “BUSINESS NAME”, ignore “Home”

2. **Domain (secondary clue)**
   - Ignore protocol (`http://`, `https://`) and `www.`.
   - Ignore TLDs like `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, etc.
   - Break the remaining domain part into words based on hyphens or readable chunks.
   - If the domain clearly encodes the brand, you can use it to:
     - Confirm the guess from the title.
     - Refine spacing/capitalization (e.g., `bluewavesoftwash.com` → “BlueWave Softwash”).
   - If the title is generic but the domain is clearly branded:
     - Title: “Pressure Washing Services”  
       Domain: `rivercitypressurewashing.com`  
       → business name: `River City Pressure Washing`

3. **Current DB name (tie-breaker / backup)**
   - If the title is **ambiguous or generic**, and the DB name looks like a plausible business name, use the DB name AFTER cleaning suffixes.
   - If the title provides a **clear, stronger** business name than the DB name, prefer the title.
   - If the DB name is clearly generic or mismatched, ignore it.

  → `BlueWave Softwash`

- Title: “Pressure Washing Services”  
  → `NONE` (no unique identifier)

- Title: “Professional Cleaning Dallas”  
  → `NONE` (too generic)

- Title: “Contact Us | ABC Company”  
  → `ABC Company`

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC EDGE CASES

1. **Multi-location names**
   - Keep the full branded phrase, including the location, if it appears in the name:
     - “Sparkle Wash of Tampa Bay” → `Sparkle Wash of Tampa Bay`
     - “Window Genie of North Dallas” → `Window Genie of North Dallas`

2. **Combination brands**
   - If a brand name plus a strong service phrase appear together, keep them all:
     - “Deck Doctor Wood Restoration” → `Deck Doctor Wood Restoration`
     - “Prestige Pressure & Window Cleaning” → `Prestige Pressure & Window Cleaning`

3. **Social media pages**
   - “Sparkle Wash Power Washing | Facebook” → `Sparkle Wash Power Washing`
   - “Hydro Softwash (@hydrosoftwash) • Instagram Photos and Videos” → `Hydro Softwash`
   - If ONLY the platform name is present (e.g. “Pressure Washing – Facebook”), and no clear contractor name → `NONE`

---

FINAL DECISION RULES (follow in order):

1. Try to locate a unique business name in the title using the patterns and rules above.
2. Clean off:
   - page-level labels (Home, Welcome to, Services, Contact, etc.)
   - legal suffixes (LLC, Inc, Co, Ltd, etc.) unless clearly part of brand.
3. If the title is too generic but the domain clearly encodes a unique brand, derive the name from the domain.
4. Use the Current DB name only as a backup or tie-breaker when the title is ambiguous.
5. If after all this there is no clear, unique business identity, return `NONE`.

---

OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL):

- Output **only** the business name as plain text.
- Do NOT include quotes, extra words, explanations, or labels.
- If there is no valid business name, output exactly: `NONE`

NOW EXTRACT FROM: "{title}"
